# CG Git Repo

A repo where I can quickly upload any and all work related to this semester's CG class, either for submission or to easily access between my lap and desk tops.



Week 3s lecture work is our first serious test with creating our own shaders. This build contains the three shaders we were told to make in class in a small demo scene with added a custom skybox of some of my old concept art for last year's GDW game.

I think once I get the shaders working I have a good idea of how to implement and tweak them to my desired results, my weaknesses are definitely in speed and getting them working. I know I'm not a strong programmer so I struggled with keeping up with the rest of the class while trying to get my shaders to work, this is something that I hope to improve with practice.
