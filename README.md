# CG Git Repo

A repo where I can quickly upload any and all work related to this semesters CG class, either for submission or to easily access between my lap and desk tops.



Week 3s lecture work is our first serious test with creating our own shaders. This build contain the three shaders we where told to make in class in a mall demo scene with added custom skybox of some of my old concept art for last years GDW game.
